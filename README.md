EDUrain is a platform dedicated to helping every student attend college. We help students file for scholarships for free, and offer a free housing search through our housing engine. Additionally, we’ve built into our platform other services to make the student’s life easier, including renter’s insurance, credit building, and roommate matching! We’re constantly improving our website as we build our startup, so look out for new features that are on the way!
